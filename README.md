# 📜 Introduction

The "Daily Transactions" dataset contains information on dummy transactions made by
an individual on a daily basis. The dataset includes data on the products that were
purchased, the amount spent on each product, the date and time of each transaction,
the payment mode of each transaction, and the source of each record
(Expense/Income).
This dataset can be used to analyze purchasing behavior and money management,
forecasting expenses, and optimizing savings and budgeting strategies. The dataset is
well-suited for data analysis and machine learning applications; it can be used to train
predictive models and make data-driven decisions.

# 📑 Conclusion 📑

*This comprehensive analysis provided a robust understanding of the daily household transaction dataset. It effectively demonstrated that the individual's household transactions are small; a few large transactions significantly affect the overall distribution of amounts. 'Saving Bank Account 1' and 'Cash' emerged as the primary modes of transaction. Key financial areas included significant income entries ('Salary'), substantial investments ('Fixed Deposit', 'Public Provident Fund'), and regular household expenditures ('Food', 'Transportation', 'Home'). The time-series analysis successfully highlighted monthly, daily, and yearly patterns, offering insights into the temporal aspects of financial behavior. The systematic preprocessing steps ensured the data was clean, consistent, and well-structured for these in-depth explorations.*
